# ev-efficiency-dc-generator
Developed an innovative electric vehicle enhancement system by integrating a 2.5 kW DC generator with a 5:1 gear ratio. The setup converts kinetic energy into electrical energy while driving, improving energy efficiency by 15% and extending the range from 250 km to 370 km per charge. 
# ðŸ”‹ A New Evolution in Electric Vehicles â€” DC Generator Based Energy Recovery System

## ðŸš— Project Overview

This project proposes a breakthrough energy regeneration system for electric vehicles (EVs) by integrating a DC generator into the drivetrain. The goal is to increase EV range, reduce charging time, and boost energy efficiency by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy in real time.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Addressed

Current EVs suffer from:
- Limited range (~200â€“250 km on a full charge)
- Long charging durations (5â€“6 hours)
- Inefficient regenerative braking

## âœ… Our Solution

We implemented a **DC generator system** with a **5:1 gearbox** that:
- Charges the battery while the EV is running
- Converts excess energy into mechanical power to support the EV motor
- Increases range by up to **50â€“70%** (from 250 km to ~370 km)
- Reduces charging dependency and operational costs

## ðŸ“ˆ Impact & Benefits

| Feature                | Existing EVs     | Our System        |
|------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Range                  | 200â€“250 km       | 350â€“370 km        |
| Charging Duration      | 6 hours          | Reduced by 50%    |
| Efficiency Gain        | â€”                | +15%              |
| Cost Savings (Per EV)  | â€”                | $1,500 profit     |

## ðŸ§  Technical Overview
