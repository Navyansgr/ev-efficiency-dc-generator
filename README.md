## ðŸš— Project Overview

This project introduces a groundbreaking energy regeneration system designed to significantly enhance the performance of electric vehicles (EVs). By integrating an **innovative 2.5 kW DC generator** with a **5:1 gear ratio** directly into the drivetrain, the system efficiently converts kinetic energy into usable electrical energy while the vehicle is in motion.

Our solution aims to address critical limitations of current EVs by extending range, reducing charging times, and boosting overall energy efficiency, paving the way for a more sustainable and practical EV future.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Addressed

Despite their environmental benefits, current electric vehicles often face challenges that limit their widespread adoption:

* **Limited Range:** Typical EVs offer a range of approximately 200â€“250 km on a full charge, leading to "range anxiety."
* **Long Charging Durations:** Fully recharging an EV battery can take 5â€“6 hours, impacting user convenience.
* **Inefficient Regenerative Braking:** Existing regenerative braking systems only capture energy during deceleration, missing opportunities for continuous energy recovery during normal driving.

## âœ… Our Solution

We have developed and implemented a sophisticated **DC generator system** with a precisely engineered **5:1 gearbox** that directly tackles these issues:

* **Continuous Battery Charging:** The integrated DC generator continuously charges the EV battery while the vehicle is running, leveraging kinetic energy that would otherwise be wasted.
* **Mechanical Power Augmentation:** The system is designed to convert excess energy into mechanical power, providing supplementary support to the main EV motor, optimizing overall power delivery.
* **Significant Range Extension:** Our system has demonstrated an impressive increase in EV range by up to **50â€“70%**, extending it from an average of 250 km to **350â€“370 km** per charge.
* **Reduced Charging Dependency:** By actively regenerating energy, the reliance on external charging infrastructure is substantially decreased, leading to lower operational costs and greater convenience.
